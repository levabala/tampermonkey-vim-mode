# Make visual selection height match caret height

## Problem

The visual selection overlay and the caret should have the same height for visual consistency.

## Tasks

- [ ] Ensure visual selection height matches caret height
- [ ] Remove border from visual selection overlay

## Technical Notes

- Visual selection styling is likely in the visual mode implementation
- Caret styling may be separate from selection overlay
- Both elements should use consistent height calculations
